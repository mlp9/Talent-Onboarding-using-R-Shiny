She has been quick to understandthe product (m-pesa) and has demonstrated understanding of the businessand its applications. A keen mind and positive attitude along withperseverance has helped her get started.Hits vs Target on \"What\" aspect of performance:Tie up with a Microfinance company that will also help acquireVodafone customers has been a key closure. This will be the first SMEclosure for ANE and will prove to be a key differentiatorMisses vs Target on \"What\" aspect of performance:She has to get involved in the CSE piece that she has not been able totill now.

She demonstrated this whendealing with the B2C client who was initially not willing to continueworking with us, but is now the best account.Misses on \"How\" aspect of performance(Vodafone Way Behaviours):Bemishal needs to drive her agenda more by working closely with theBDMs more. She needs to push her priorities more, especially since thebusiness is in its infancy.Specific Focus on Way Forward:She needs to priortize and prepare her funnel for bulk accounts. Thesame has to be integrated and updated in a tracker so that she hascomplete visibility on the same. She should also demand more resourcesavailable so that she stays on top of all developments.She should now start delivering on bulk accounts starting with fewsmall accounts and then scaling up.

He has shown his commitment to achievehigher results.Ramendra has done well on alternate channel and has been among the topfive nationally. Agent appointment and appointment of ED channel aheadof curve was a major achievement. Circle has empowered the retailer andcustomer through automation of processes for agent location finding andagent settlement. And overall mix of the business was fair acrosssegments.Ramendra has been ambitious in setting up alternate channel and hasdeployed 14 EDs and 226 agents, which have helped growth of transactionvalue. He has engaged well with these guys to improve productivity /agent and training of these channel partners have helped in achievingthe right transactional mix. Engagement with the distribution team atfrontline has helped in improving the UTA and UAA performance. Projecton ADVMS has helped in development of Mpesa in these corridors.Ramendra has not been able to achieve the transaction through puttargets. At the same time UU performance has been below DB. As regardsdevelopment of eco-system for mpesa is concerned, Ramendra has not beenable to add more B2B / B2C / merchants in the circle, this would havehelped circle in achieving big shift target.Ramendra\\'s engagement and ability to influence decision making withcross functional teams like sales and marketing has resulted inunder-achievement of acquisition and UU targets, which in turn resultedin lower achievement of transactional value targets. Further projectslike red hills did not take off, which resulted in lack of eco-systemfor taking up the mpesa. His distribution while at UAA and UTA levelhas done well, the distribution rigor and hygiene leaves much to bedesired.He needs to improve his skills to influence key stake holders, whichwould not only help him improve mpesa business but will also himdevelop as good professional.MYPD:Ramendra has done well in mpesa. He has shown his commitment to achievehigher results.Ramendra has done well on alternate channel and transation value byachieving 153% of the target. UAA and UTA of the circle has been doingwell.

At the same time UU performance has been below DB.Further while the circle is above DB on transaction value, it\\'s shorton Big Shift target. As regards development of eco-system for mpesa isconcerned, Ramendra has not been able to add more B2B / B2C / merchantsin the circle, this would have helped circle in achieving big shifttarget.Ramendra engagement with cross functional teams and involvement of crossfunctional teams in achieving mpesa agents appointment and acquisitionhas resulted in performance below DB. The team lacks analytical skillsand working in coordination with marketing which resulted in low UUperformance. At the same time, Ramendra\\'s understanding of consumerneeds and as a result, development of eco-system to meet the consumerneeds have impacted the overall growth of mpesa in circle. Mpesa UKproject, which was purely made on building mpesa as differentiator inthe market, was not executed at all.Going forward, Ramendra need to work closely with other verticals atCircle, not only in terms target sharing, but also in terms of mutualunderstanding on business requirement. He need to work on making mpesaa big differentator in UK, while the project has been conceived, it isyet to see execution on the ground. Further, best practices like SBICSP, ADVMS as Mpesa Hubs need to be executed with perfection on theground to get good mileage on the ground.He needs to improve his analytical skills, which will help himunderstand the retail and customer segmentation, which in turn willhelp in identifying the engagement drivers for both of them, whichshould help the circle increase extraction on mpesa.Angshuman had a very good run for the year 14-15 m pesa Cs processeswere lead from the front and each area / parameter was seamlesslystitched as and when required. The platform migration was managed verysmoothly with virtually zero escalations or senior managementinterventions, what ever was faltering in H1 like the CPS also gotcorrected in H2 with rigour and all of this resulted in the m pesASCORE CARD being no 2 in the country. Angshuman has done this thruadoption of through product process knowledge, strong integration withcross verticals and maintaining tight governance.

Has been displaying the qualities of simplicity and trustat various junctures. His contribution to CS forte Is noteworthy . H2has witnessed him travelling across branches which is a welcomeinitiative and should be continued. Built in good visibility with thecircle leadership team though the corporate connect still needsimprovement. Has been far more vocal and polished compared to earlieryear but has to continue in this journey and establish more repo withother circle peers as well as corporate m pesa vertical.Angshuman needs to invest now into the interaction quality at inbound CCfor m pesa as well as can improve on the initiatives and connect withcustomers thru outbound. This has been a miss in the current year andan area of opportunity. The CO is a work force which needs morevisibility as well as rigour and display of their utility to thebusiness is what can be worked upon. This can be done by doingstructured reviewes with the m pesa team as well as connecting withthem regularly and putting them into use on the circle business askover and above their critical role of audits. The tracking of closelooping of these audits can be the mechanism to optimally utilize thiswork force.Angsuhman has to invest time into distribution aspect and should walk upand take a project on same which shall be the ladder for his careeraspiration of being a business head for m pesa. He has to take thisinitiative along with SLT facilitation and now that the BAU is veryvery stable should work fast paced into this direction.

He established andnurtured good interpersonal relations with BDMs and other crossfunctional stakeholders.Misses on \"How\" aspect of performance (Vodafone Way Behaviours):A very close work and proactive approach with key sales functions(distribution/retail) would have helped to deliver better performanceon customer acquisition and agent participation (UAA/UTA). Similarly -anticipating disruptions post new platform launch - agent appointmentsshould have been planned well.Specific Focus on Way Forward:Now that he knows the intricacies and nuances of Mpesa business verywell - he is expected to improve the customer acquisition, agentappointment and participation performance rapidly.
